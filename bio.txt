Working across industries and job functions has been a great celebration of my
systems-thinking and adaptability. An entrepreneur at heart and a creative
problem-solver in team environments, my 12 years abroad in Germany working
with some of Europe's biggest brands has given me a wealth of knowledge and a
transferrable skillset. My post-graduate studies in Psychology have diversified my
knowledge in community engagement, campaign development, social impact
initiatives, project management, design thinking and cross-collaboration.

Inclusion, accessibility and equity are common themes in all areas of my
professional and personal endeavours. And I inform my advocacy through
ongoing professional development and networking. My current focus areas
include measuring social impact, design thinking, futures thinking, emerging
technologies and ethical marketing.
